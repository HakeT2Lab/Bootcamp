<h1>Intrests</h1>
<ul>

  <p>When I say reading, I dont mean facebook or twitterr posts.
    I mean flat out reading, I know, its a rare skill in my generation.</p>

  <li>VideoGaming</li>
  <p>Aw, something everyone was expected. Granted I do spend to long
  playing a good game. My favorites being minecraft and terraria both
hevealy modded.</p>

<h1>A Little about me.</h1>
<p>I am a 20 something american male college student stumbling my way through life. I dont really have many hobbies,
so much so that I find myself boreing. I sadly am still depended on parents to live my life,
 but I plan to soon change that if the world is willing. I am of Bajan(from Barbados) decent with the majority of my
 family being from the island.
<br><br>
I major in (genral)Computer science as I have yet to decide on a department. I am one of the poor
students that choose to come to college without a plan first. I can feel the death glare my future
self is giving me right now. Did I mention that I hate math?
